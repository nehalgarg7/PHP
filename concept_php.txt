An integer is a number without any decimal part.

An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2147483648 and 2147483647 in 32 bit systems, and between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer.

Note: Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5).

Here are some rules for integers:

An integer must have at least one digit
An integer must NOT have a decimal point
An integer can be either positive or negative
Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)


PHP has the following predefined constants for integers:

PHP_INT_MAX - The largest integer supported
PHP_INT_MIN - The smallest integer supported
PHP_INT_SIZE -  The size of an integer in bytes

PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:

is_int()
is_integer() - alias of is_int()
is_long() - alias of is_int()
Example


// Float 

PHP has the following predefined constants for floats (from PHP 7.2):

PHP_FLOAT_MAX - The largest representable floating point number
PHP_FLOAT_MIN - The smallest representable positive floating point number
PHP_FLOAT_DIG - The number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a float and back without precision loss
PHP_FLOAT_EPSILON - The smallest representable positive number x, so that x + 1.0 != 1.0
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is float:

is_float()
is_double() - alias of is_float

// Infinite

A numeric value that is larger than PHP_FLOAT_MAX is considered infinite.

PHP has the following functions to check if a numeric value is finite or infinite:

is_finite()
is_infinite()

// NAN (Not a Number)

NaN is used for impossible mathematical operations.

PHP has the following functions to check if a value is not a number:

is_nan()

// PHP Numerical Strings
The PHP is_numeric() function can be used to find whether a variable is numeric. The function returns true if the variable is a number or a numeric string, false otherwise.
